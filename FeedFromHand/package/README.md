# Feed From Hand
Do you love taming animals in Valheim, but hate how they ignore your food offerings? Do you wish you could feed them directly from your hand, like in Minecraft? If so, you might want to check out my mod: Feed From Hand.

Feed From Hand is a mod that lets you interact with your furry friends in a more realistic and satisfying way. You can feed them any food item from your inventory, and they will happily munch on it. You will also see a heart and hand gesture animation to show your affection.

This mod is compatible with the latest version of Valheim, and requires BepInEx to work. You can download it from the link below. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
